# fcc-image-search
Created with CodeSandbox

The client discuss with an API hosted on glitch and
- sends the image query to :
    -- https://witty-dry.glitch.me/search?query=${_search}&offset=${_offset}
- send the history query to :
    -- https://witty-dry.glitch.me/history

This API uses the Qwant search request and thus is limited in query from the API (You might get an error sometimes).
